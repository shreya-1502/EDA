# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
It is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that involves analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights and inform subsequent modeling decisions. 
EDA helps in understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset. Here are some key aspects of EDA in the context of machine learning:

# Descriptive Statistics:
Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) to describe the central tendency and dispersion of the data.
Examine the distribution of each feature to understand the range and variability.
